Guile-DBI
=========
guile-dbi provides a simple, generic, easy-to-use scheme/guile interface
to SQL databases, such as Postgres or MySQL.

The system is split into two parts: the DBI (database independent) part,
which provides the scheme interfaces, and the DBD (database dependent)
plugins, which connect to the actual SQL server. Currently, there are
DBD backends for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite3.

Please see the [master README file](../README.md) for more info.
